A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It provides an efficient way to store and manipulate data dynamically.

## Features
- Insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the linked list.
- Searching for an element in the linked list.
- Traversing the linked list and printing its elements.
